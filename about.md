My name is Collin DeVore. I am a doctoral economics student at the University of Oklahoma. My research is in industrial organization and applied microeconomics, with a current focus on airlines. I am interested in better understanding the way that mergers affect industries, and the way that policies have driven change within industries.

I have worked on four main papers during my time at the University of Oklahoma. I have examined the aftereffects of the CARES Act, price asymmetry, airline subcontracting networks, and the process by which mergers affect subcontracting.
