Hello. My name is Collin DeVore. I am a doctoral economics student at the University of Oklahoma. My research is in industrial organization and applied microeconomics. Currently, I am working on the economics of airlines. I am interested in better understanding the way that mergers affect industries, and the way that policies have driven change within the airline industry.
