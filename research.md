  Questions regarding the effectiveness of different subsidies, along with the efficiency
and stability they may provide, have been researched widely within the field of economics.
However, the effects that result from the conclusion of subsidization have received considerably
less attention. As a case study, this analysis focuses on the CARES Act subsidy
and its influence on the airline industry. The CARES Act, implemented in March 2020,
provided funding for airlines amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding consisted of
a twenty-five billion dollar allotment from the government across all airlines, which was
awarded based on the preceding year’s employment costs. This paper examines whether
this act led to improvements in quality or productivity within the airline industry after the
initial CARES Act shock subsided. Binary regression methods and on-time performance
data are utilized to this end. Ultimately, I find that, by my most conservative estimates,
the CARES Act’s resolution led to decreased quality, with a dip in worker productivity.

<p>This page provides selections from my work as a graduate student and an undergraduate student. Each of the graduate projects were researched and turned in in the spring of 2019, while the undergraduate work was turned in at different times. Though more honors courses were taken, much of the contracts are provided. The two contracts that are omitted are my earliest works, which consist of a research paper on the five stages of decomposition in Entomology in the spring of 2014 and a research paper on big data from the fall of 2014. These two papers have been omitted due to their disappearance from my computer's memory, along with the lack of relevance of the entomology paper. Feel free to view my work and get a feel for my research and writing style.  </p>
